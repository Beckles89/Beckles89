**CompTIA Security+**  
[View Credential](https://www.credly.com/badges/710236c3-aa48-4b71-a094-08df5ac1fac9/public_url)


## Objective

The Home Detection Lab project aimed to establish a controlled environment for simulating and detecting cyber-attacks. The primary focus was to ingest and analyze logs within a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, generating test telemetry to mimic real-world attack scenarios. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of network security, attack patterns, and defensive strategies.
